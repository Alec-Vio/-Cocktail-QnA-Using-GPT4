# Cocktail Question and Answering
This example demonstrates the capability of EvaDB in extracting embedding from texts, building similarity index, and using **local LLM** to answer question based on that. For this example, we use a txt full of various cocktail recipes in a consistent format as the source for our demonstration purpose.

This app is powered by EvaDB and GPT4All. No OpenAI API Key is necessary.
